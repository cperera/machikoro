An implementation in python of the board game Machi Koro

I'm a board game enthusiast, and I thought I would spend some time building a python version of a simple game, Machi Koro.

Machi Koro is a game in which players each build up their versions of a town called Machi Koro. They buy cards that represent buildings from a central supply, and they earn income by rolling dice. Each player starts with some base buildings and an initial amount of money. The winner is the first to buy the full set of four landmarks, each of which adds something to the rules.

I'm programming this with my friend Chris Reyes, using ping-pong pair programming.
